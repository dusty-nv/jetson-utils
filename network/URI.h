/**
 * Resource URI of a video device, IP stream, or file/directory.
 *
 * The URI object is used by videoSource, videoOutput, and videoOptions to identify which resource 
 * is being streamed.  It will parse a string into protocol, path, and port/extension components.
 *
 * URI protocols for videoSource input streams include MIPI CSI cameras (`csi://`), V4L2 cameras (`v4l2://`), 
 * RTP/RTSP networking streams (`rtp://` and `rtsp://`), and disk-based videos/images/directories (`file://`) 
 *
 *     -  `csi://0` for MIPI CSI cameras, where `0` can be replaced with the camera port.
 *        It is also assumed that if a number with no protocol is specified (e.g. `"0"`),
 *        this means to use the MIPI CSI camera of that number (`"0"` -> `csi://0`)
 *
 *     - `v4l2:///dev/video0` for V4L2 cameras, where `/dev/video0` can be replaced with
 *        a different video device (e.g. `v4l2:///dev/video1` for V4L2 video device `1`).
 *        If no protocol is specified but the string begins with `/dev/video`, then it is
 *        assumed that the protocol is V4L2 (`/dev/video0` -> `v4l2:///dev/video0`)
 *
 *     - `rtp://@:1234` to recieve an RTP network stream, where `1234` is the port and `@` is shorthand
 *        for localhost.  `@` can also be substituted for the IP address of a multicast group.
 *        Note that it is important to manually specify the codec and width/height when using RTP,
 *        as these values cannot be discovered from the RTP stream itself and need to be provided.
 *        @see videoOptions for more info about `--input-codec`, `--input-width`, and `--input-height`.
 *
 *     - `rtsp://username:password@<remote-host>:1234` to subscribe to an RTSP network stream, where
 *        `<remote-host>` should be substituted for the remote host's IP address or hostname, and 
 *        `1234` is the port.  For example, `rtsp://192.168.1.2:5000`.  The `username` and `password` 
 *        are optional, and are only used for RTSP streams that require authentication.
 *
 *     - `file:///home/user/my_video.mp4` for disk-based videos, images, and directories of images.
 *        You can leave off the `file://` protocol identifier and it will be deduced from the path.
 *        It can be a relative or absolute path.  If a directory is specified that contains images,
 *        those images will be loaded in sequence (sorted alphanumerically).  The path can also
 *        contain wildcard characters, for example `"images/ *.jpg"` - however when using wildcards
 *        from the command line, enclose the string in quotes otherwise the OS will pre-expand them.
 *        Supported video formats for loading include MKV, MP4, AVI, and FLV. Supported codecs for 
 *        decoding include H.264, H.265, VP8, VP9, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, and MJPEG. Supported image formats
 *        for loading include JPG, PNG, TGA, BMP, GIF, PSD, HDR, PIC, and PNM (PPM/PGM binary).
 *
 * URI protocols for videoOutput streams include rendering to displays (`display://`), broadcasting RTP/RTSP 
 * streams (`rtp://`, `rtsp://`), WebRTC streams (`webrtc://`), and saving videos/images to disk (`file://`) 
 *
 *     - `display://0` for rendering to display using OpenGL, where `0` corresponds to the display number.
 *        By default, an OpenGL window will be created, unless the `--headless` command line option is used.
 *
 *     - `rtp://<remote-host>:1234` to broadcast a compressed RTP stream to a remote host, where you should
 *        substitute `<remote-host>` with the remote host's IP address or hostname, and `1234` is the port.
 *
 *     - `rtsp://@:8554/my_stream` to serve a compressed RTSP stream at the specified port and stream path.
 *        RTSP clients can connect to the stream at the specified path.  Using this will create a RTSP server
 *        that can handle multiple videoOutput streams on the same port but with different paths
 *        (e.g. `rtsp://<hostname>:8554/my_stream_1`, `rtsp://<hostname>:8554/my_stream_2`, ect)
 *
 *     - `webrtc://@:1234/my_stream` to serve a compressed WebRTC stream at the specified port and path
 *        that browsers can connect to and view.  Users will be able to navigate their browser to
 *        `http://<hostname>:1234/my_stream` and view a rudimentary video player that plays the stream.
 *        More advanced web front-ends can be created by using standard client-side Javascript WebRTC APIs.
 *
 *     - `file:///home/user/my_video.mp4` for saving videos, images, and directories of images to disk.
 *        You can leave off the `file://` protocol identifier and it will be deduced from the path.
 *        It can be a relative or absolute path.  You can output a sequence of images using a path of
 *        the form `my_dir/image_%i.jpg` (where `%i` can include printf-style modifiers like `%03i`).  
 *        The `%i` will be replaced with the image number in the sequence.  If just a directory is
 *        specified, then by default it will create a sequence of the form `%i.jpg` in that directory.
 *        Supported video formats for saving include MKV, MP4, AVI, and FLV. Supported codecs for 
 *        encoding include H.264, H.265, VP8, VP9, and MJPEG. Supported image formats for saving 
 *        include JPG, PNG, TGA, and BMP.
 *
 * The URI strings used should take one of the above forms for input/output streams to be parsed correctly.
