 * Load an image or set of images from disk into GPU memory.

 * Supported image formats for loading are JPG, PNG, TGA, BMP, GIF, PSD, HDR,
 * PIC, and PNM (PPM/PGM binary). Internally, imageLoader uses the loadImage() 
 * function to load the images, so the supported formats are the same.
 *
 * imageLoader has the ability to load an sequence of images from a directory,
 * including wildcard characters (e.g. `images/ *.jpg`), or just a single image.
 * When given just the path to a directory, it will load all valid images from
 * that directory.
 *
 * @note imageLoader implements the videoSource interface and is intended to
 * be used through that as opposed to directly.  videoSource implements
 * additional command-line parsing of videoOptions to construct instances.
