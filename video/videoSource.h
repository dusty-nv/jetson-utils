/**
 * The videoSource API is for capturing frames from video input devices such as MIPI CSI cameras, 
 * V4L2 cameras, video/images files from disk, directories containing a sequence of images, 
 * and from RTP/RTSP network video streams over UDP/IP.
 *
 * videoSource interfaces are implemented by gstCamera, gstDecoder, and imageLoader.
 * The specific implementation is selected at runtime based on the type of resource URI.
 *
 * videoSource supports the following protocols and resource URI's:
 *
 *     -  `csi://0` for MIPI CSI cameras, where `0` can be replaced with the camera port.
 *        It is also assumed that if a number with no protocol is specified (e.g. `"0"`),
 *        this means to use the MIPI CSI camera of that number (`"0"` -> `csi://0`).
 *
 *     - `v4l2:///dev/video0` for V4L2 cameras, where `/dev/video0` can be replaced with
 *        a different video device (e.g. `v4l2:///dev/video1` for V4L2 video device `1`).
 *        If no protocol is specified but the string begins with `/dev/video`, then it is
 *        assumed that the protocol is V4L2 (`/dev/video0` -> `v4l2:///dev/video0`)
 *
 *     - `rtp://@:1234` to recieve an RTP network stream, where `1234` is the port and `@` is shorthand
 *        for localhost.  `@` can also be substituted for the IP address of a multicast group.
 *        Note that it is important to manually specify the codec of the stream when using RTP,
 *        as the codec cannot be discovered from the RTP stream itself and need to be provided.
 *        @see videoOptions for more info about the `--input-codec` option.
 *
 *     - `rtsp://username:password@<remote-host>:1234` to subscribe to an RTSP network stream, where
 *        `<remote-host>` should be substituted for the remote host's IP address or hostname, and 
 *        `1234` is the port.  For example, `rtsp://192.168.1.2:5000`.  The `username` and `password` 
 *        are optional, and are only used for RTSP streams that require authentication.
 *
 *     - `file:///home/user/my_video.mp4` for disk-based videos, images, and directories of images.
 *        You can leave off the `file://` protocol identifier and it will be deduced from the path.
 *        It can be a relative or absolute path.  If a directory is specified that contains images,
 *        those images will be loaded in sequence (sorted alphanumerically).  The path can also
 *        contain wildcard characters, for example `"images/ *.jpg"` - however when using wildcards
 *        from the command line, enclose the string in quotes otherwise the OS will pre-expand them.
 *        Supported video formats for loading include MKV, MP4, AVI, and FLV. Supported codecs for 
 *        decoding include H.264, H.265, VP8, VP9, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, and MJPEG. Supported image formats
 *        for loading include JPG, PNG, TGA, BMP, GIF, PSD, HDR, PIC, and PNM (PPM/PGM binary).
 *  
 * @see URI for info about resource URI formats.
 * @see videoOptions for additional options and command-line arguments.
