/**
 * MIPI CSI and V4L2 camera capture using GStreamer and `nvarguscamerasrc` or `v4l2src` elements.
 * gstCamera supports both MIPI CSI cameras and V4L2-compliant devices like USB webcams.
 *
 * Examples of MIPI CSI cameras that work out of the box are the OV5693 module from the
 * Jetson TX1/TX2 devkits, and the IMX219 sensor from the Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2.
 *
 * For MIPI CSI cameras, the GStreamer element `nvarguscamerasrc` will be used for capture.
 * For V4L2 devices, the GStreamer element `v4l2src` will be used for camera capture.
 *
 * gstCamera uses CUDA underneath for any necessary colorspace conversion, and provides
 * the captured image frames in CUDA device memory, or zero-copy shared CPU/GPU memory.
 *
 * @note gstCamera now implements the videoSource interface and is intended to be used through 
 * that as opposed to directly. videoSource implements additional command-line parsing of 
 * videoOptions to construct instances. Some legacy APIs of gstCamera are now marked deprecated.
 *
 * @see videoSource
